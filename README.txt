This is a project for a todo list.

1. The user is suppose to write in the input field and press a submit button,
then the text will show on the website with a remove button.

2. The user will get a error message if the use writes something invalid,
in this case (less than 3 words.)

3. The todo list is going to have local storage enabled. So when the browser
refreshes it will collect the todo list from browser storage and update it when
the user removes or adds items to the todo list.
